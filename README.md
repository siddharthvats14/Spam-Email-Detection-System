### Introduction

This project is an implementation of a logistic regression machine learning model to detect spam emails. The model is trained on a dataset of emails, with each email labeled as either spam or not spam. The model uses various features of the email, such as the sender, subject, and body, to make its predictions.

### Technical Stack

1.Python 3.x
2.Scikit-learn
3.Pandas
4.NumPy
5.NLTK

### Functionality

1.Data preprocessing
2.Feature extraction
3.Model training
4.Model testing
5.Prediction

### Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command:

> pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage

To use the project, run the main file spam_detection.py. This will load the dataset, preprocess the data, extract the features, train the model, test the model, and make predictions on new emails.

### Training and Testing

The model is trained and tested on the provided dataset. The accuracy and other metrics of the model are calculated and printed to the console.

### Project Structure

data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
models/: Contains the trained logistic regression model.
notebooks/: Contains Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis and model development.
src/: Contains the main file spam_detection.py and other utility files.
